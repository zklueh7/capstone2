Capstone 2 Ideas

1
A website to find climbing partners. 
Having a climbing partner is required for most types of climbing. When climbing with a rope, a person called a belayer is necessary to catch the climber if they fall. Finding a good climbing partner can be tough. Ideally your partner is of similar ability, experience, and has similar goals. There are sometimes bulletin boards at climbing gyms where folks looking for partners can post their contact info, but this can lead to varying results. Additionally, finding a partner for a trip to an outdoor destination is similarly challenging. 
The website I propose building would have pages for climbing gyms, and climbing destinations where having a partner is necessary. Users could create a profile with information about themselves and post on message boards to connect with partners. Users could also directly message other people. Users could also review partners they have climbed with. I could use data from a weather API to display the current weather at the home pages for the climbing areas.

A website to plan camping trips. 
There are so many beautiful spots to camp and explore outside in Colorado that it can be overwhelming to plan a trip. Choosing where to go, and making sure there are available sites and that the site meets the requirements you are looking for can be time consuming.
The website I propose building would create a weekend trip for the user depending on their desired criteria. The user would be able to decide the maximum distance they want to travel, how many nights they want to stay, what amenities they would like while camping, and what activities they would want to do on their trip. The website would take these criteria and match it with a destination with an available site that matches their criteria, taking the stress out of planning and making the decision of where to go. This website would utilize the RIDB API, which is an API created by the US department of recreation.
