##### About Catchapp
CatchApp is a web application designed to connect people looking for climbing partners. Having a climbing partner is required for most types of climbing. When climbing with a rope, a "belayer" is necessary to catch the climber if they fall. Finding a good climbing partner can be tough. Ideally your partner is of similar ability, experience, and has similar goals. Occasionally climbing gyms will have bulletin boards where folks looking for partners can post their contact info, but this can lead to varying results. Additionally, finding a partner at an outdoor area can be similarly if not more challenging. The purpose of this web application is to solve this problem by supplying a series of online message boards organized by area where climbers can post if they are looking for a partner. Users can create profiles that show the specific type of climbing they are interested in and their experience level to enable better matches between climbing partners.

##### Features and User Flow
The CatchApp home page will either show links to the login/register pages if a user is not logged in, or links to the search/user profile/logout pages if the user is logged in. The user profile page allows the user to view and/or edit their profile information. The search page allows the user to search for a climbing area. The user can select one of the climbing areas which will take them to the home page for that area. The area home page contains a description for that area and links to check the weather for that area or go to the area's message board where user's can post and respond to other user's messages.
